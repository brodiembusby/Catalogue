# Catalog a Fullstack Application
## Introduction
This project is a fullstack web application using React for the frontend and Java with Spring Security for the backend.

This is the repository for the frontend and will only work if MongoDB is set up and the other repository Catalog Backend are working. This is purely a Educational Repo and was used to understand full stack applications. All Images were web scraped from TCDB. 

To use CD into catalog-v1 and then npm start. Make sure you have NodeJS installed as well and may have to do a npm install to make it work. To verify a email make sure you have maildev working on your computer and this will allow for verification through MongoDB.

#### Chrome has edited the way that images are sourced so the images wont display anymore without some CORS fix
